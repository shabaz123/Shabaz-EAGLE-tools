EAGLE CAD tools

Compile on any PC using gcc -o <program_name> <source_name.c>
When run, it will prompt for parameters in order to generate a script file suitable for EAGLE.

The source code is self-explanatory.

smd_tool.c is ideal for generating dual row (e.g. SOIC) and square (e.g. QFP) packages.
toroid_tool.c is ideal for generating packages for toroid inductors, either vertically or horizontally mounted.

hpgl2eagle.c is used for converting from many line/graphic image formats into EAGLE format. See the 
hpgl2eagle-notes.txt file for further information on this.
